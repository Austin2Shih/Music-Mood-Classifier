      "I believe that the biggest improvement to my model can only be made by training with better data. Unfortunately, good data is difficult to come by since not many datasets provide mood and raw audio files. I've already tried a few other datasets but upon data exploration, I decided they weren't fit for training.",
      "Once I find a better dataset, I'll attempt to train a more powerful model using Convolutional Neural Networks. Feel free to contact me with recommendations for datasets. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
